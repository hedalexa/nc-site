            <p>“As her moniker implies, she takes no prisoners, channeling the fury instilled by worldly injustices into blistering, defiant sets." - Mixmag 2017</p>

                <p>Raised in small-town Indiana on a musical diet of 80s synth pop and punk rock, Noncompliant soon found barnyard raves and warehouse techno parties and (as DJ Shiva) quickly became a fixture of the fabled 90s Midwest USA rave scene.</p>
                
                <p>Two decades and a name change later, she is at the top of her techno game. Mixmag named her one of 2017’s Top 20 Breakthrough DJs. She owned a packed and sweaty Boiler Room during Movement Detroit, turned in mindblowing mixes for Slam Radio, Crack Magazine, and Resident Advisor, and quaked some of the world’s most respected dance floors like Smartbar Chicago, Nowadays NYC, Amsterdam’s DeSchool, Concrete in Paris, Munich’s Blitz Club, and Berlin's legendary Berghain and Tresor clubs. Her festival appearances include Unsound, Red Bull Music Festival Paris, Movement Detroit, Colombia’s Freedomfest, and Whole United Queer Festival.</p>
                
                <p>As a producer, her releases and remixes on labels like Valence, Argot, Flash, and Dark Entries have pounded sound systems worldwide, with her tune “Women’s Work” landing on Fiedel’s official Berghain 08 mix and on his label Fiedeltwo.</p>
                
                <p>At her core, she is a die-hard techno fan with a deep love for music and a drive to continue honing her craft as a DJ and producer to share her favorite music with people on dance floors everywhere.</p>
